#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The input and output grow at the same porportion so it's Linear O(n). N increases n^3 but a in increases a ^ 2 as well.

b) The for loop is O(n) and the while loop increases by half so it's O(n log) making the result O(n log n)

c) The recursion moves towards the base case in direct porportion so it's Linear O(n)

## Exercise II
